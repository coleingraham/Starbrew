A mod for Starbound adding the ability to brew beer.

What is does:
- craft a Brewing Station which lets you brew various typs of beer
- create malts from barley via the stone furnace
- barley and hops are found as drops and in treasures on tear1 planets (for now)

Installation:
- cd to your Starbound directory (google how to find this based on your system)
- create a folder called mods (if it isn't there already)
- cd mods/
- git clone https://github.com/coleingraham/Starbrew.git

Setup:
- open bootstrap.config (google how to find this based on your system)
- add "../mods/Starbrew" to the list (when in doubt, check google)
- create a new character in Starbound (the Wooden Brewing Station will be added to your starting crafting blueprints)
